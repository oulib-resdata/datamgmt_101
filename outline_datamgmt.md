# Managing Research Data
## Survival Skills | DAVIS Workshop

***
Contributors: Amanda Schilling & Mark Laufersweiler

Session goals for participants:
- understand file naming best-practices
- understand file/directory organization best-practices
- be able to write a readme file with necessary elements
- understand how to organize data in the correct format; spreadsheet or database

***

Concepts to be covered:
1. File Naming
  - use dash, underscore, or capitalization in place of spaces or other characters; spaces and some special characters will make it difficult or impossible for files to be machine readable by some programs
  - use dates and initials for naming files where this information is crucial; e.g. if you are recording data on over a span of time name files YYYYMMDDleafcolor.dat or with multiple observers YYYYMMDD_counts_AS.csv and YYYYMMDD_counts_CMC.csv
  - file extensions are important for identifying what they are and what you can use to run the files; e.g. data vs text vs executable
  - example using: https://www.arm.gov/policies/datapolicies/formatting-and-file-naming-protocols

2. File organization - use directories to organize your files; an example:
```
     MyResearchProject/
      |
      +-- data/
      |   |
      |   +-- raw/
      |   |
      |   +-- reduced/
      |
      +-- analysis/
      |   |
      |   +-- question1/
      |   |
      |   +-- question2/
      |
      +-- literature/
      |
      +-- writeup/
```
3. README - a plain text file that gives a description of the project, information about what is contained in the directory and subdirectories, file naming scheme, any other information that would help you remember where you are and what you're doing, information that would help someone else understand your files
- Details from website: https://libraries.ou.edu/content/how-make-readmetxt-file

4. Spreadsheet or Database? **_I welcome comments/suggestions/reading material from anyone since this is not an area that I know much about_**

Workshop centered around the activity - give learners example project files with some good and some bad data management
- Digital (would require learners to bring computers and either download before the workshop or take time at the beginning; not ideal for a 50-60min session)
- Paper - have several kits ready and distribute them at the beginning; bring extra materials for "fixing"; each kit contains:
  - Files w/examples of good and bad file naming
     - images/plots w/filename written on back
     - envelopes with "data" inside
  - Directories - folder(s) with "files" inside, some good practices, some bad
  - README - notebook paper attached to some folders

Activities
1. "Can you find measurement *A* taken on *this* date?"  discuss file naming, organization
2. Discuss positives and negatives of each "kit"
3. Fix each kit - more folders, add READMEs, write/draw directory map
