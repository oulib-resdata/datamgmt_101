# Managing Research Data
## Survival Skills | DAVIS Workshop
***
Contributors: Amanda Schilling & Mark Laufersweiler

Session goals for participants:
- understand file naming best-practices
- understand file/directory organization best-practices
- be able to write a readme file with necessary elements
- understand how to organize data in the correct format; spreadsheet or database
***
Concepts to be covered:
1. File Naming
  - use dot, dash, underscore, or capitalization in place of spaces or other characters; spaces and some special characters will make it difficult or impossible for files to be machine readable by some programs
  - use dates for naming files where this information is crucial; e.g. if you are recording data on over a span of time name files YYYYMMDDleafcolor.dat
  - file extensions are important for identifying what they are and what you can use to run the files; e.g. data vs text vs executable

2. File organization - use directories to organize your files; an example:
```
     MyResearchProject/
      |
      +-- data/
      |   |
      |   +-- raw/
      |   |
      |   +-- reduced/
      |
      +-- analysis/
      |   |
      |   +-- question1/
      |   |
      |   +-- question2/
      |
      +-- literature/
      |
      +-- writeup/
```
3. README - a plain text file that gives a description of the project, information about what is contained in the directory and subdirectories, any other information that would help you remember where you are and what you're doing, information that would help someone else understand your files

4. Spreadsheet or Database?
***
Workshop centered around the activity - give learners example project files with some good and some bad data management
- Digital (would require learners to bring computers and either download before the workshop or take time at the beginning; not ideal for a 50-60min session)
- Paper - have several kits ready and distribute them at the beginning
  - envelopes with "data" inside as files, some have "good" file names written on the envelope
  - folder(s) with "files" inside, some good practices, some bad
  - notebook paper attached to some folders as README

Activities
1. Can you find measurement *A* taken on *this* date?  Can discuss file naming, organization
2. Disscuss positives and negatives of
