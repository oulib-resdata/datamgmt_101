## Survival Skills | DAVIS Workshop

***
Contributors: Amanda Schilling & Mark Laufersweiler

Session goals for participants:
- understand file naming best-practices
- understand file/directory organization best-practices
- be able to write a readme file with necessary elements
- understand how to organize data in the correct format; spreadsheet or database

Motivation. Why you should care. [~5 mins] Managing Research Data allows you to plan ahead, make choices about how you will save and organize your data.  Considering these things early helps with
* ability to find files
* ability to understand what is contained in your files
* sharing data/files/results
* collaboration

Show example research project files and discuss. [5-7 mins]
   Leading questions; e.g "I come back to this after working on a job application.  Where is the data I collected on December 17?", "What is this file/directory?"  

Concepts to be covered; use above discussion when possible
1. File Naming [7-10 mins]
   - use dash, underscore, or capitalization in place of spaces or other characters; spaces and some special characters will make it difficult or impossible for files to be machine readable by some programs
   - use dates and initials for naming files where this information is crucial; e.g. if you are recording data on over a span of time name files YYYYMMDDleafcolor.dat or with multiple observers YYYYMMDD_counts_AS.csv and YYYYMMDD_counts_CMC.csv
   - file extensions are important for identifying what they are and what you can use to run the files; e.g. data vs text vs executable

2. File organization [~5 mins] - use directories to organize your files
3. README [7-10 mins] - a plain text file that gives a description of the project, information about what is contained in the directory and subdirectories, file naming scheme, any other information that would help you remember where you are and what you're doing, information that would help someone else understand your files.  Details from website: https://libraries.ou.edu/content/how-make-readmetxt-file
4. Spreadsheet or Database? [7-10 mins]

Back to example research project files. [~5 mins]  What can we change to fix the problems?
