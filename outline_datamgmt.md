# Managing Research Data
## Survival Skills | DAVIS Workshop

***
Contributors: Amanda Schilling & Mark Laufersweiler

Session goals for participants:
- understand file naming best-practices
- understand file/directory organization best-practices
- be able to write a readme file with necessary elements
- understand how to organize data in the correct format; spreadsheet or database

***

Motivation. Why you should care. [~5 mins] 
   - What? The way your data is organized/saved; e.g.
      * file names/organization
      * where data is stored & backed up
      * long-term - how data will be made public
   - Planning early, as you begin helps with
      * ability to find files
      * ability to understand what is contained in your files
      * sharing data/files/results
      * collaboration
   - Today discuss some simple steps to manage your data to hopefully same you some grief/time later 

Show example research project files and discuss. [5-7 mins]
  "Amanda's Research Project - a graduate student is studying spiral galaxies and the supermassive black holes at the center of these galaxies.  She has images, spectra, some preliminary measurements and analysis, as well as some background information in this directory."
  Amanda will share this folder with an undergrad working with her over the summer.  Take just a few minutes to discuss/think about what information the undergrad can get just by looking at this.

Concepts to be covered; use above discussion when possible
1. File Naming [7-10 mins]
   - use dash, underscore, or capitalization in place of spaces or other characters; spaces and some special characters will make it difficult or impossible for files to be machine readable by some programs
   - use dates and initials for naming files where this information is crucial; e.g. if you are recording data on over a span of time name files YYYYMMDDleafcolor.dat or with multiple observers YYYYMMDD_counts_AS.csv and YYYYMMDD_counts_CMC.csv
   - file extensions are important for identifying what they are and what you can use to run the files; e.g. data vs text vs executable

2. File organization [~5 mins] - use directories to organize your files
3. README [7-10 mins] - a plain text file that gives a description of the project, information about what is contained in the directory and subdirectories, file naming scheme, any other information that would help you remember where you are and what you're doing, information that would help someone else understand your files.  Details from website: https://libraries.ou.edu/content/how-make-readmetxt-file
4. Spreadsheet or Database? [7-10 mins]

Back to example research project files. [~5 mins]  What can we change to fix the problems?
